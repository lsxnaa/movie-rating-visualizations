title: "IMDb Ratings of Popular U.S. Movies in the 2010s"

### A Brief Introduction

After a busy week, when the weekend finally arrives, how do you relieve yourself from stress? Going for a movie, at least before the outbreak in 2020, is one of the most popular options. However, choosing a high-quality one may be difficult. This motivates us to investigate which of the most popular movies are also highly rated.

To assist our decision, Internet Movie Dataset (IMDb) offers an incredible database of movie information and ratings. This website has continuously updated [Top 250](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top) and [Top 1000](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_1000) charts that rank all past movies based on their user vote counts and ratings. It also introduces a proprietary metric, named MOVIEmeter, that ranks movies by popularity.

Considering the unprecedented impacts of Covid-19, I limited the studyâ€™s time scope to the past decade from 2010 to 2019. Location-wise, I decided to focus on the U.S. cinema, well known as Hollywood, since it is the oldest and the largest film industry. In brief, this study investigates the subset of English U.S. movies that were released in the 2010s and have a high popularity rank on IMDb.

Our main question of interest surrounds the potential factors associated with the ratings of these movies. This study aims to highlight the most influential factors contributing to a high movie rating in the recent decade.


### About the Dataset

The dataset includes 300 most popular English U.S. movies on IMDb that were released in the 2010s.

Using Python's [Requests]{.ul} and [Beautiful Soup]{.ul} libraries, I scraped movies' data directly from the IMDb website, which allows for personal and non-commercial use.

Since we are interested in the whole decade, for each of the 10 years, I selected the top 30 movies based on IMDb's popularity metrics (i.e. MOVIEmeter). In addition, to minimize the impacts of wrongful ratings, I set a threshold on the number of votes. I set the threshold at 25000, because this is the official threshold used by IMDb as a minimum criterion to enter their [Top chart](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top).

The dataset is accurate as of February 16, 2022. For each of the 300 movies, the dataset includes the following information:

-   `title`: a movie's English title, unique in this dataset

-   `rating`: the average rating on a scale from 1 to 10, rounded to 1 decimal place

-   `votes`: the total number of votes

-   `run time`: the run time of a movie, in minutes

-   `domestic gross`: gross box office in U.S. and Canada, in millions of U.S. dollars

-   `worldwide gross`: gross box office worldwide, in millions of U.S. dollars

-   `year`: the year in which a movie was released

-   `genre`: the main genre of a movie

-   `director`: the first, main director in the directors list

-   `star`: the first, main star in the stars list
